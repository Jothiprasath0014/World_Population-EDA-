# World_Population (EDA)

### Exploratory Data Analysis for the World Population dataset

The primary goal of this case study is to analyze the world population dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about global population growth over time. The dataset contains population data for different countries and continents from 1970 to 2022, allowing us to study historical population trends and current demographic distributions.

### Dataset Overview:
#### Columns:
* Country, Continent, 1970 Population, 1980 Population, 1990 Population, ..., 2022 Population
* Data Type: Numerical (Population), Categorical (Country, Continent)
* Period Covered: 1970â€“2022
* Key Metrics: Population counts for various years, growth trends

## EDA Highlights:

#### * Descriptive Statistics:

Summary of population data for each year.
Identification of countries with the highest and lowest populations in 2022.

#### * Data Cleaning:

Handling of missing values (e.g., checking isnull()).
Validation of unique and duplicate entries.

#### * Correlation Analysis:

Correlation between populations across decades to identify growth trends.
Visualized using heatmaps.

#### * Comparative Analysis:

Grouping data by continent to calculate average population per year.
Visualization of population trends across continents over time.

#### *Outlier Detection:

Boxplots to highlight countries with extreme population sizes.

#### * Trend Analysis:

Line plots to depict population growth trends globally and by continent.
